# MockSimpleComic
A testbed for using Apple's Vision framework with SimpleComic

This uses an NSImageView in a NSScrollView as a toy version of TSSTPageView. It has one page,
a compiled-in page from Django Zorro as sample data.

When run, it displays that page, scaled, in scrollbars. It initially covers most of the page
with a yellow tint.

It runs the Vision.framework OCR engine. Once that completes, it tints just the places where
it recognized text.

If run under Xcode, it will log the recognized text to Xcode's console.

On the menubar, Select All, Copy, and Start Speaking work, as do items on the Services submenu.

Example of the start of what it found with this sample page.
