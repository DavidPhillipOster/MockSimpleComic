# MockSimpleComic
A testbed for using Apple's Vision framework with SimpleComic

This uses an NSImageView in a NSScrollView as a toy version of TSSTPageView. It has one page,
a compiled-in page from Django Zorro as sample data.

When run, it displays that page, scaled, in scrollbars. It initially covers most of the page
with a yellow tint.

It runs the Vision.framework OCR engine. Once that completes, you can use the mouse to select
text in place (look for the i-Beam cursor), and it tints just the places where it recognized text.

All of the actual OCRing is moved off to a OCRVision object, which provides a simple API for
OCRing.

This app creates a VNRecognizeTextRequest to recognize all the text in an image. That's all you need
to select individual lines of text in the image, or if you just need the text to
index it for Spotlight. 

If you want to mouse select not lines, but individual words, you'd think you could use a
VNDetectTextRectanglesRequest, since the header file says it will return the bounds of individual
characters - but, it does not work: it returns the same set of bounds that VNRecognizeTextRequest
does.

On the menubar, Select All, Copy, and Start Speaking work, as do items on the Services submenu.

Control-Click on selected text for a contextual menu. (Simple Comic uses right click for its
magnifying glass.)

Example of the start of the text it found with this sample page.
